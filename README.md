Help USAFA Doolie'ss study for their knowledge tests

## Overview
k-test is a simple python script for memorizing text answers, which must be typed exactly, to a set of questions.  The script essentially forces you to type each answer corrrectly, from the beginning, before moving on to the next question.  "Essentially" because the script does have the option of allowing the wrong character to be typed n times, where n is set on the command line for all questions.  It also will show the full answer if asked, or move to the next or previous question.
